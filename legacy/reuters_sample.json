Hong Kong reverts to China on midnight June 30, and the following two days are public holidays. Hong Kong people are invited to wear stylish cheungsams and jackets in the style of the 10th century Tang Dynasty, a golden era of Chinese civilisation, and send in donations to the charity.",

        "The forecast for Tuesday calls for snow in Philadelphia -- Garth Snow.",

        "Hextall was not at his sharpest in Saturday's series-opening 4-2 defeat, especially on Detroit's fourth goal -- a very long slap shot by Steve Yzerman that Hextall probably should have stopped.",
        "\"In the playoffs you have to make the big save,\" Murray said after Monday's practice. \"You couldn't fault Hextall on any of the first three goals Saturday, they were all odd man rushes in which we made defensive mistakes.\"",
        "But the fourth goal really hurt the Flyers chances of pulling out a victory.",

        "The Flyers also announced that defenceman Petr Svoboda and left wing Dan Kordic were both questionable for the remainder of the series. Svoboda sustained a fractured first metatarsal bone in his right foot in the second period of Saturday's game and Kordic suffered a fractured left thumb on his first shift.",
        "Murray has done some goalie juggling in these playoffs.",
        "Snow was sharp against Pittsburgh and Buffalo but was pulled after falling behind in the second game of the Eastern Conference finals with the New York Rangers. Hextall finished that game and played the rest of the series before getting the nod to start against Detroit in the finals.",
        "\"We started Snow in the first playoff series against Pittsburgh and he did well, then seemed to lose focus in the Ranger series,\" Murray said. \"We put Hexie back in and he won three straight.\"",
        "Murray seemed unconcerned about starting a potentially disruptive goaltender controversy.",
        "\"I would consider the change again,\" he said. \"I don't like to play musical chairs, but we feel very good about both goaltenders.",
        "\"We have two number one goalies, but right now for Tuesday I'm starting Snow.\"",
        "Murray said when informed of the change Monday morning, Hextall handled the news in a professional matter.",
        "\"When you lose a game, you make adjustments, that's the bottom line,\" said Hextall, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs in 1987 when the Flyers lost to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games.",
        "\"We're playing against a better hockey team than we have played all along. We do need to make some adjustments, so we're not hitting the panic button,\" Hextall continued.",
        "\"I'm not upset. Both of us are used to Murray switching his goalies around. If they need me I'm ready.\"",
        "The Flyers vowed to help Snow more than they had Hextall in Game 1, which Murray called \"our worst game in the playoffs so far.\"",
        "\"We need to get with it, stop standing around and being happy we are in the finals,\" said left wing John Leclair of the Flyers' feared Legion of Doom line with centre Eric Lindros and right wing Mikael Renberg.",

        "Former Flyers star and current general manager Bob Clarke said: \"I think we can win with either goalie.\"",

        "\"The mark is under a lot of pressure given the concern about the general EMU environment,\" said James McKay, economist at PaineWebber International. \"People are getting out of Europe and into dollar assets as a safe haven against a wide EMU.\"",

        "But mark bulls have not given up hope.",
        "\"I thought mark/Paris and mark/lira would go higher but there were too many longs out there, and they got squeezed out,\" said a trader at IBJ.",
        "\"Still, it looks like Germany is going to struggle to meet the criteria, but doesn't want to soften them,\" he said. This could spur more traders to look for a delay to EMU and give the mark a boost in the coming weeks, he said.",
        "Seventy-two percent of analysts and traders polled by Reuters Monday expect EMU to go ahead on time in 1999, down from 82 percent on May 14. Also, the gap between the theoretical and the actual ecu widened to 0.57/61 from 0.25/28 on May 23 before the first round of the French elections.",
        "The dollar's surge to a two-week high against the Swiss franc prevented the franc from making headway against the mark, despite expectations it would attract flows as a safe haven from EMU turmoil.",
